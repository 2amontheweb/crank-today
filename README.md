Crank.Today

Slack app that asks employees if they felt they reached crank level today. Sends a daily report to ceo.

Going for a lighthearted/informal approach of gauging if all things are going smoothly. And gives opp for employee to speak up about any possible issues.

Slack app sends daily Slack to users at their given time of EOD. “did you crank today or nah” with choice of two buttons: yea, nah

If yea, “shibby, keep it cranking, anything you want to point out that helped you crank ?”

If nah, “the only way to achieve peak cranking is to be :100: - what kept you from cranking?”

Records reasons

ceo or manager gets a daily report:

“your teams tcp was ~70%, they said nah bc ‘reason’ and ‘reason’ and ‘reason’ they said yea bc ‘reason’ and ‘reason’
